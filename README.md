# 1AM-Pixel-Dreams
DVC Project for Spring 2022 @ Project Bracket (A CS club)


Intro:
Hello everyone, 

My name is Brian Leong and I am one of the Project Managers for one of the groups in Project Bracket at DVC.
This project was started sometime around February, and it initially started with 16 members.
However, college and personal deals got in the way of many members from being able to contribute
to the project, as a matter of fact, some members just dissappeared during our beginning phases.
For about 16 weeks, me and the other Project Manager were able to work with about 8 people to get this project together.
As of recently, many of our members have had summer classes, so progress is slowing further with only about
4 people working on the project.
Nevertheless, we have all put in a lot of work in this project, and will still continue to do so to try to come up with
a complete project. I think at this point we all have a lot of learning we want to do outside of this project, so
we'll see where things go.

Information about this repository:
You'll find two main folders. The first folder named 1AM, contains all of the project files. Midsemester contains all
the files that were gathered for a midsemester presentation we had. There you can find some of our early concepts
as well as various documentation.
NOTE: The pixelorama-master file is not technically part of the project. It was just a software used to develop
various assets in the game.

Game information:
This game is coded using Godot Game Engine 3. All scripts are written in GDScript!
