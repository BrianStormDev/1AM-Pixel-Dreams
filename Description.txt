Pixel Dreams is a platformer game that takes players on a journey through various college class
themed levels each with unique enemies, platforms, and player weapons with the goal of scoring enough points
to make it to the finish line. All our developers worked hard to make sure that all components ranging from enemies, 
weapons, physics interactions, and environments were up to par. The game is still undergoing further development, 
but upon completion, there are plans to upload the code to itch.io with HTML5 compatibility so that 
everyone can see what just a few college students can do :)

Software Used: Godot 3.4 Game Engine, GD Scripting, Pixelorama
